# Throttle Control Using Hand Gestures
## Description
This project implements an innovative throttle control system using hand gesture recognition. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret hand movements and translate them into throttle commands, offering a hands-free and intuitive method of controlling vehicle speed or drone acceleration.
## Features
Real-time hand detection and gesture recognition,
Throttle control mapping based on specific hand gestures,
Safety mechanisms to prevent unintended throttle adjustments,
Configurable gesture-to-throttle mappings,
Environmental adaptability for various lighting conditions
## Technologies Used
- OpenCV for computer vision tasks<br>
- Python for main implementation<br>
